				<p>I discovered Open source at <a href="http://www.ljmu.ac.uk">University</a> and haven't looked back since.</p><br>

                <p>Whilst juggling a Software engineering degree I started Security Forums with a friend, that became a popular and well respected community covering IT security, and was later acquired by a larger established network.   This gave me my first insight into open source contribution and sharing, as I contributed to <a href="https://www.phpbb.com">phpBB</a> from financial contributions to helping others on IRC, and advocating use of the software.    During these years I taught myself Linux using every opportunity to use open source software, especially around hosting and networking</p><br>

                <p>My placement year at University was at Liverpool agency Mando Group, to which I returned after graduating.   Despite my education being largely based around programming, I quickly found my interests lay in infrastructure.   I spent a few years in IT support, progressing to running internal networks and production hosting infrastructures.   I couldn’t have asked for a better start to my IT career, and learned how important trust and integrity are in business; core values I maintain to this day.</p><br>

                <p>In 2003 I moved to a <a href="http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/1973538/virtual-gp-patients-charge">startup</a> post the Dot-com bubble that wanted to make medical records available online.    I set up the cross-platform hosting for the product and ran the internal infrastructure.  Everything looked good with a working product, exposure & press with a management team who had previously built and exited medical companies.   Unfortunately funding ran out and the company closed (the DH <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/aug/03/nhs-medical-records-mps">couldn’t solve the problem with <em>billions</em></a> either).</p><br>

                <p>This gave me the opportunity to startup myself, and I co-founded <a href="http://www.ixis.co.uk">Ixis</a>.   We used <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> for the first web project and quickly decided to use it for all future builds.    We bootstrapped the business with no external funding, doing a mixture of IT consultancy, web builds and hosting.    After a few years we focused exclusively on Drupal, and hit a <a href="http://www.ixis.co.uk/blog/we-are-10-today-look-back">10 year milestone</a>.   Ixis have contributed back to Drupal via a mixture of code, financially, helping others and evangelism.</p> <br>

                 <p>I took Ixis to a 20 strong technical Drupal agency helping large organisations and companies build, scale and manage their Drupal applications.    My role also evolved from being a technical hands-on sys admin to sales, growth and commercials.
                        In 2017 I completed a <a href="https://www.prolificnorth.co.uk/2017/05/carter-completes-management-buy-out-of-ixis">management buy-out</a> and left Ixis.</p><br>

                <p>I have also been involved building two other communities, that were also both acquired.     My involvement was initially around the build and technical side, but then moved into growth and monetisation.</p><br>

                <p>In 2016 <a href="https://blog.chrishaslam.co.uk/6-months-of-investing-ff8591bc31eb">I invested</a> in 15 early stage companies, and have continued to invest in further seed rounds including <a href="https://www.prolificnorth.co.uk/2016/04/herb-kim-and-steve-pankhurst-among-investors-in-six-figure-funding-round-by-m14-industries/">M14 industries</a> and <a href="https://teacherly.io/">Teacherly</a>.   I've also invested in multiple crowdsourced rounds including <a href="http://monzo.com">Monzo</a>, BrewDog & <a href="http://www.boulderhut.com/">Boulder Hut</a>.</p><br>
